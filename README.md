### Activating

To use all features of ENJINN, you need to activate it with a [license key](https://gum.co/enjinn).

> ENJINN only requires an internet connection during activation and never again.

To activate ENJINN, run the `activate` command. Paste in your license key when prompted and you're all set!

```
$ enjinn activate
```

### Free vs Paid

The free version has several restrictions:

- Smart playlists: Up to 5 playlists, 2 filters each
- Relocate: Basic macthing only. Premium will add the ability to fix individual tracks as well as handle renamed files.
- Playlist import: Will be premium only.

### Library configuration

The first time you run a command, it will ask you to enter the location of your Engine library.

If you would like to change this later, you can edit the config file.

In the future, you'll be able to specify multiple Engine libraries and even switch between them (possibly, let me know if you think this would be useful).

#### Config file locations:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\enjinn-nodejs\Config\config.yaml`
- macOS: `~Library/Preferences/enjinn-nodejs/config.yaml`

## üî® Commands

- üß† [`smart` - Generate smart playlists](#-smart)
- üîç [`relocate` - Relocate missing tracks](#-relocate)

### üß† Smart

Generates smart playlists based off a config file located in your Engine library folder.

```
$ enjinn smart
```

To configure the smart playlists, place a file called `enjinn.yaml` in your Engine library folder. See the [examples](examples/enjinn.example.yaml) to learn how to define playlists.

If a playlist already exists (at the root level) with the same name as one of your smart playlists **IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN**. In most cases this is desired, as you'll want to update your smart playlists.

### üîç Relocate

Finds tracks in your library that are missing, because you've moved the files to a new folder.

```
$ enjinn relocate
```

ENJINN will scan your library for tracks that are missing on disk. It will then ask you to specify a folder to search for your tracks in. It will also search up to 5 subfolders deep. After searching, it will print out the relocated tracks and their new paths.

Currently, the filenames have to be the same, but soon you'll be able to specify rules for matching filenames as well as rename individual files.
